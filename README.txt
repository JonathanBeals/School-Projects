This is my final project for CSCI-110. Im hoping to have all of these things included into my code by the end of it. I was trying to include most of what i learned this semester. I tried to make it so it printed what the user won money wise after every time the users turtle won twice but that got a little too complicated for the time I had left.

ask name.

ask what turtle to bet on. (add a read and write file)

ask what the user wants to bet.

set up turtle.

draw rectangle.

draw track.

draw a square.

draw start and finish lines.

make turtles race.

announce winner.

thanks for playing. would you like to play again?

reset race and start again.
